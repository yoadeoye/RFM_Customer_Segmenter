# RFM_Customer_Segmenter
RFM_Customer_Segmenter, focuses on customer segmentation using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) analysis to understand and optimize purchasing behaviour on an e-commerce platform. By leveraging real-world transaction data, the project assigns RFM scores to customers, categorizing them into segments such as high-value, at-risk, and loyalist. The analysis enables businesses to gain actionable insights into customer behaviour, identifying trends and patterns that drive purchasing decisions. The project further explores tailored marketing strategies to enhance customer retention, re-engage at-risk customers, and maximize the lifetime value of loyalists. Through data-driven techniques, it provides a framework for e-commerce platforms to design personalized campaigns, improving customer engagement and boosting revenue. The repository includes code, visualizations, and documentation to facilitate easy implementation and interpretation of RFM-based segmentation for business applications.
